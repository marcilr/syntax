View Branches


To view all branches:

$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
$

The asterisk next to "master" in the first line of the output
indicates that we are currently on that branch.  The second
line simply indicates that on our remote, named origin, there
is a single branch, also called master.
