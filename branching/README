  Branch
  When you create a repository, by default it has one branch with the name
  master.  You could keep working on this branch and have only one, that's
  fine.  But if you have another feature or idea you want to work on, you can
  create another branch, starting from master, so that you can leave master in
  its working state.

  Branching
  Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature",
  and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so
  special?  The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching
  operations nearly instantaneous and switching back and forth between
  branches generally just as fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages
  a workflow that branches and merges often, even multiple times in a day.
  Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique
  tool and can literally change the way that you develop.
