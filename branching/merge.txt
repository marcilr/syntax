Merge branch

1. Verify on correct branch to merge to with 'git status':
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$

or

$ git branch -a
  develop
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
$

If needed switch to receiving branch with:
$ git checkout <receiving> 


2. Fetch latest remote commits:
$ git fetch

Ensure the master branch has the latest updates by executing:
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
$

3. Once the prior "preparing to merge" steps have been 
done merge with:
$ git merge <branch name>

Example:
$ git merge develop
Already up-to-date.
