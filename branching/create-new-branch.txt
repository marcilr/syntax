To create a new branch

1. Go to your new repository hello-world.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
4. Select the blue Create branch box or hit "Enter" on your keyboard.

Now you have two branches, master and readme-edits.  They look exactly the
same, but not for long!
