Working on the migration of work repositories to proper location.

1. List remotes:
$ cd ~/git/gci/automic/
$ git remote -v
origin    ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/automic (fetch)
origin    ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/automic (push)
$

2. Update origin url with 'git remote set-url' command:

FIXME: Need data here.
