Short Status
============
While the git status output is pretty comprehensive, itâ€™s also quite wordy. Git
also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way.
If you run git status -s or git status --short you get a far more simpli-
fied output from the command.
  $ git status -s
  M README
  MM Rakefile
  A lib/git.rb
  M lib/simplegit.rb
  ?? LICENSE.txt

Displays nothing if not changes.
