Updated remote origin


1. List current origin or remote:
Desktop$ git remote -v
origin	ssh://htpc/data/git/hosts/gci/covellite/home/marcilr/Desktop/Desktop (fetch)
origin	ssh://htpc/data/git/hosts/gci/covellite/home/marcilr/Desktop/Desktop (push)
Desktop$ 

NOTE: The above url for Desktop no longer exists.  It has been migrated to
      htpc:/data/git/gci/Desktop/Desktop/

2. Remove old origin:

Desktop$ git remote rm origin
Desktop$ git remote -v
Desktop$ 

Prior origin removed.

3. Add origin:

Desktop$ git remote add origin ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/Desktop/Desktop/
Desktop$ 

$ git remote -v origin ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/hosts/covellite/home/marcilr/Desktop/Desktop (push) $
origin	ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/Desktop/Desktop/ (fetch)
origin	ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/Desktop/Desktop/ (push)
$

$ git pull origin master
From ssh://htpc/data/git/gci/Desktop/Desktop
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
Already up-to-date.
$

$ git push
Everything up-to-date
$ 


Looks good!
