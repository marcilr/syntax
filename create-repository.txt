Create a Repository


A repository is the basic unit of GitHub, most commonly a single project.
Repositories can contain folders and files, including images - anything your
project needs.  Because we recommend including a README, or a file describing
the project, in every repository, GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same
time you create your new repository.  It also offers other common options such
as a license file, but we can skip that for now.


Create repository via cli
=========================
1. Create desired directory for repo:
$ cd ~/git/
$ mkdir gnano

2. Initialize git repo:
covellite:~/git$ cd ~/git/gnano
covellite:~/git/gnano$ ls
covellite:~/git/gnano$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/marcilr/git/gnano/.git/
covellite:~/git/gnano$

3. See status of repo:
covellite:~/git/gnano$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
covellite:~/git/gnano$


To create a new repository (via online interface)
========================== 
1. Click the  icon next to your username, top-right.
2. Name your repository hello-world.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select Initialize this repository with a README.
5. Click Create repository. Boom, repository!
