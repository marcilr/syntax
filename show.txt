Show


It will show you the committer (with the data you set before), the timestamp,
and the commit hash.

You can also see the last commit with:
  $ git show

It will automatically open $PAGER (more, less, ...), and show you the contents
of your last commit.  git show also accepts a hash as argument. My commit hash
is: 1aab8486d20490st 7-8 characters are enough.  So, we can also use: for each
of you.  It isn't necessary to write the full hash -- usually the first 7-8
characters are enough. So, we can also use:
  $ git show 11aab848

git also supports a number of symbolic names, but I won't go into this, since I
believe it's more than basic (I'm talking about HEAD, HEAD^, HEAD~2 and so on)
