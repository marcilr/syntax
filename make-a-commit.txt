Make a commit


On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.  Commits are pretty glorious,
because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.

Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description
explaining why a particular change was made.  Thanks to these messages, you
and others can read through commits and understand what you've done and why.

You should still be on the code view for your readme-edits branch, now make
some changes!

To commit changes
1. Click the README file.
2. Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3. In the editor, write some text, tell a bit about yourself.
4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.

Click Commit changes. Now these changes have been made to the README file on
your readme-edits branch and now this branch contains different content and
commits than master (as it should!).
