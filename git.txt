git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
  -- distributed-is-the-new-centralized

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with
features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple
workflows.

=============================
I migrated the root git repository from public GitHub to private htpc.
The public root repo would have the private repository paths exposed to
the public.  Thought it best to keep this data private.  Especially since
it exposes financial or work data.


Clone github repo
=================
git$ git clone https://github.com/marcilr/git-github.git github
