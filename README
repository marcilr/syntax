  Remotes
  To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how
  to manage your remote repositories.  Remote repositories are versions
  of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
  You can have several of them, each of which generally is either
  read-only or read/write for you.  Collaborating with others involves
  managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to
  and from them when you need to share work.  Managing remote
  repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories,
  remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote
  branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more.  In
  this section, we'll cover some of these remote-management skills.
