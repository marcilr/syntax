  Branching
  Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature",
  and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so
  special?  The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching
  operations nearly instantaneous and switching back and forth between
  branches generally just as fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a
  workflow that branches and merges often, even multiple times in a day.
  Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique
  tool and can literally change the way that you develop.
