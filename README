branching.txt
  Branching
  Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature",
  and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so
  special?  The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching 
  operations nearly instantaneous and switching back and forth between
  branches generally just as fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages 
  a workflow that branches and merges often, even multiple times in a day.
  Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique
  tool and can literally change the way that you develop.

clone.txt
  Clone repository
  If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository - for example, a project
  you'd like to contribute to - the command you need is git clone . If you're
  familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you'll notice that the command
  is "clone" and not "checkout".  This is an important distinction - instead
  of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that
  the server has.

gitignore.txt
  Ignoring Files

  Often, you'll have a class of files that you don't want Git to automatically
  add or even show you as being untracked.  These are generally automatically
  generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system.  In
  such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named
 .gitignore .  Here is an example .gitignore file:

  $ cat .gitignore
  *.[oa]
  *~

go-to-particular-revison.txt
  Use git checkout <sha1> to check out a particular commit.

help.txt
  Help
  If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual
  page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

  $ git help <verb>
  $ git <verb> --help
  $ man git-<verb>

  For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running

  $ git help config

  progit-en.478.pdf, Pro Git, p. 41

init.txt
  init
  If you're starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to

open-a-pull-request.txt
  Open a Pull Request

  Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.  When you make a pull
  request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in
  your contribution - aka merge them into their branch.  GitHub's Pull Request
  feature allows you to compare the content on two branches.  The changes,
  additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs
  (differences).

transfer-protocol.txt
  Transfer Protocol
  Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous
  example uses the https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or
  user@server:path/to/repo.git , which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
  "Getting Git on a Server" will introduce all of the available options the server
  can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.

workflow.txt
  The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
  1. You modify files in your working directory.
  2. You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
  3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and
     stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
