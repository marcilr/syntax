Transfer Protocol


Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous
example uses the https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or
user@server:path/to/repo.git , which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
"Getting Git on a Server" will introduce all of the available options the server
can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.
