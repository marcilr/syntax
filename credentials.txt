Credentials


GitHub cache password
=====================
Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password
in memory for some time.  By default, Git will cache your password
for 15 minutes.

In Terminal, enter the following:

git config --global credential.helper cache
# Set git to use the credential memory cache
To change the default password cache timeout, enter the following:

git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
# Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)
