Branching


Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature", and
it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so special?  The
way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly
instantaneous and switching back and forth between branches generally just as
fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and
merges often, even multiple times in a day.  Understanding and mastering this
feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can literally change the way
that you develop.
