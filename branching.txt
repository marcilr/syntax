Branching


Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature", and
it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so special?  The
way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly
instantaneous and switching back and forth between branches generally just as
fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and
merges often, even multiple times in a day.  Understanding and mastering this
feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can literally change the way
that you develop.

Synopsis
========
git branch [--color[=<when>] | --no-color] [-r | -a]
	[--list] [-v [--abbrev=<length> | --no-abbrev]]
	[--column[=<options>] | --no-column]
	[(--merged | --no-merged | --contains) [<commit>]] [--sort=<key>]
	[--points-at <object>] [<pattern>…​]
git branch [--set-upstream | --track | --no-track] [-l] [-f] <branchname> [<start-point>]
git branch (--set-upstream-to=<upstream> | -u <upstream>) [<branchname>]
git branch --unset-upstream [<branchname>]
git branch (-m | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>
git branch (-d | -D) [-r] <branchname>…​
git branch --edit-description [<branchname>]

--list
======
If --list is given, or if there are no non-option arguments,
existing branches are listed; the current branch will be
highlighted with an asterisk. Option -r causes the remote-tracking
branches to be listed, and option -a shows both local and remote
branches.  If a <pattern> is given, it is used as a shell wildcard
to restrict the output to matching branches.  If multiple patterns
are given, a branch is shown if it matches any of the patterns.
Note that when providing a <pattern>, you must use --list;
otherwise the command is interpreted as branch creation.
