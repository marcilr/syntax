Undelete file


$ git checkout <deletedFile>

--stackoverflow.com/questions/953481/


I successfully used this simple syntax to undelete a git file
immediately after deletion.

Find the last commit that affected the given path.  As the file isn't in the
HEAD commit, this commit must have deleted it.

git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>
Then checkout the version at the commit before, using the caret (^) symbol:

git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>
Or in one command, if $file is the file in question.

git checkout $(git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- "$file")^ -- "$file"

63   The tricky bit is to checkout the commit BEFORE, using the ^ suffix.

20   What is the ^ at the end for? – ranman Apr 22 '11 at 19:32

Wow, there is some tricky syntax above.


Example
=======
Mistakenly deleted git/src/daemons/tftpd.txt:

covellite:~/git/src/daemons$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    tftpd.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
covellite:~/git/src/daemons$


To restore tftpd.txt:

1. Get the version of the prior commit that in this case was the
   delete.
   
   covellite:~/git/src/daemons$ git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- .
   3a3c970faf5c9e3ac436238498a14b278cef7624
   covellite:~/git/src/daemons$

2. Run command to undelete file:
covellite:~/git/src/daemons$ git checkout \
3a3c970faf5c9e3ac436238498a14b278cef7624^ -- .
covellite:~/git/src/daemons$ 

This worked without a hitch.
