Remove file from repo

git rm --cached <file>


Examples
========
We could still remove things from the index, without leaving traces in the
repository history.  Let's do it!  Let's remove AUTHORS from the index, and
put it back to the untracked status:

git rm --cached AUTHORS

debian.org/UsingGit
