Open a Pull Request


Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.  When you make a pull
request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone pull in
your contribution - aka merge them into their branch.  GitHub's Pull Request
feature allows you to compare the content on two branches.  The changes,
additions and subtractions, are shown in green and red and called diffs
(differences).

As soon as you make a change, you can open a Pull Request.  People use Pull
Requests to start  a discussion about commits (code review) even before the
code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help when you're
stuck.

By using GitHu's @mention system in your Pull Request ssage, you can ask for
feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10
time zones away.

You can even open, as we'reoing here, a Pull Request in your own repository
and merge it yourself.  It's a great way to learn to process before working on
larger projects.

Create a Pull Request for changes to the README

Click on the image for a larger version

Click the  Pull Request icon on the sidebar, then from the Pull Request page,
click the green New pull request button.

Select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the
original).

Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they'e what
you want to submit.

When you're satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the
big green Create Pull Request button.

Give your pull request a title and since it relates directly to an open issue,
include "fixes #" and the issue number in the title.  Write a brief
description of your changes

When you're done with your message, click Create pull request!
