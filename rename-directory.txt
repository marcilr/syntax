Rename directory


Basic rename (or move):
  git mv <old name> <new name>

Case sensitive rename—eg. from casesensitive to
CaseSensitive—you must use a two step:
  git mv casesensitive tmp
  git mv tmp CaseSensitive

(More about case sensitivity in Git…)[1]

…followed by commit and push would be the simplest way to rename a directory in a git repo.
