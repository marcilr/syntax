Branching


Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its "killer feature", and
it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.  Why is it so special?  The
way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly
instantaneous and switching back and forth between branches generally just as
fast.  Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and
merges often, even multiple times in a day.  Understanding and mastering this
feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can literally change the way
that you develop.

Synopsis
========
git branch [--color[=<when>] | --no-color] [-r | -a]
	[--list] [-v [--abbrev=<length> | --no-abbrev]]
	[--column[=<options>] | --no-column]
	[(--merged | --no-merged | --contains) [<commit>]] [--sort=<key>]
	[--points-at <object>] [<pattern>…​]
git branch [--set-upstream | --track | --no-track] [-l] [-f] <branchname> [<start-point>]
git branch (--set-upstream-to=<upstream> | -u <upstream>) [<branchname>]
git branch --unset-upstream [<branchname>]
git branch (-m | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>
git branch (-d | -D) [-r] <branchname>…​
git branch --edit-description [<branchname>]
--git-scm.com/docs/git-branch


--list
======
If --list is given, or if there are no non-option arguments,
existing branches are listed; the current branch will be
highlighted with an asterisk. Option -r causes the remote-tracking
branches to be listed, and option -a shows both local and remote
branches.  If a <pattern> is given, it is used as a shell wildcard
to restrict the output to matching branches.  If multiple patterns
are given, a branch is shown if it matches any of the patterns.
Note that when providing a <pattern>, you must use --list;
otherwise the command is interpreted as branch creation.

Example
-------
covellite:~/stash/filexfer$ git branch --list
* master
covellite:~/stash/filexfer$


Basic Branching
===============
You’ve decided that you’re going to work on issue #53 in
whatever issue-tracking system your company uses.  To create
a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the
git checkout command with the -b switch:

$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"

  This is shorthand for:

$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53

Example
-------
Create 'reorg' branch for filexfer.

covellite:~/stash/filexfer$ git branch reorg
marcilr@covellite:~/stash/filexfer$ git checkout reorg
Switched to branch 'reorg'
covellite:~/stash/filexfer$ 


Example
-------
Create dev branch of the psap project:

$ git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
$

Push dev branch upstream:
$ git push --set-upstream origin dev

Check branches:
$ git branch
* dev
  master
$

Looks good.


Switch Branch
=============
Use 'git checkout <branch>' to change branch.


Example
-------
covellite:~/stash/filexfer$ git checkout master
Already on 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
covellite:~/stash/filexfer$
