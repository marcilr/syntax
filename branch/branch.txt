Branch


Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time.

When you create a repository, by default it has one branch with the name
master.  You could keep working on this branch and have only one, that's fine.
But if you have another feature or idea you want to work on, you can create
another branch, starting from master, so that you can leave master in its
working state.

When you create a branch, you're making a copy of the original branch as it
was at that point i time (like a photo snapshot).  If the original branch
changes while you're working on your new branch, no worries, you can always
pull in those updates.

You may ave, at some point in your life, saved different versions of a file
like, "story.txt", "story-joe-edit.txt", "story-sue-edit.txt".  Branches
accomplish the same goals but are easier to manage on GitHub repositories.

At GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping
bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch.
When a feature or fix is ready, the branch is merged into master.

Examples
========
Think of your git repository as a river.  At a certain point, development can
diverge from the main flow and it can stay on its own, or merge back to the
main river.  Now, our master is the main river.

Let's make a branch, let's call it debian:
  $ git branch debian

To change to this new branch, use git checkout:
  $ git checkout debian

A shortcut for the above two commands is:
  $ git checkout -b debian

Ok, so, we checked out the debian branch.  To confirm it, execute git branch,
without arguments.  It will show you the current local branches, and a * will
be prepended to the branch you're currently in.

To go back to the master branch, just: git checkout master.

debian.org/UsingGit

Create main branch of master named develope and switch to it:
  covellite:~/git/gnano$ git checkout -b develop
  Switched to a new branch 'develop'
  covellite:~/git/gnano$

  covellite:~/git/gnano$ git status
  On branch develop
  nothing to commit, working directory clean
  covellite:~/git/gnano$
