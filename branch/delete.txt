Delete branch

Executive Summary
=================
$ git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>
$ git branch -d <branch_name>

Note that in most cases the remote name is origin.


Delete Local Branch
===================
To delete the local branch use one of the following:

$ git branch -d branch_name
$ git branch -D branch_name

Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, which
only deletes the branch if it has already been fully
merged in its upstream branch.  You could also use -D,
which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes
the branch "irrespective of its merged status."
