Create a Branch


Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time.

When you create a repository, by default it has one branch with the name
master.  You could keep working on this branch and have only one, that's fine.
But if you have another feature or idea you want to work on, you can create
another branch, starting from master, so that you can leave master in its
working state.

When you create a branch, you're making a copy of the original branch as it
was at that point i time (like a photo snapshot).  If the original branch
changes while you're working on your new branch, no worries, you can always
pull in those updates.

You may ave, at some point in your life, saved different versions of a file
like, "story.txt", "story-joe-edit.txt", "story-sue-edit.txt".  Branches
accomplish the same goals but are easier to manage on GitHub repositories.

At GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping
bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch.
When a feature or fix is ready, the branch is merged into master.
