Merge your Pull Request


It's time to bring your changes together - merge your readme-edits branch into
the master branch.

1. Click the green button to merge the changes into master.
2. Click Confirm merge.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated,
with the Delete branch button in the purple box.

If you revisit the issue you opened, it's now closed! Because you included
"fixes #1" in your Pull Request title, GitHub took care of closing that
issue when the Pull Request was merged!
