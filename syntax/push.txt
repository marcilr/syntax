git-push - Update remote refs along with associated objects


Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary
to complete the given refs.
--man


When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push
it upstream.  The command for this is simple:
  git push [remote-name] [branch-name].

If you want to push your master branch to your origin server (again, cloning
generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run
this to push any commits you've done back up to the server:

  $ git push origin master

This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write
access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime.  If you and someone else
clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your
push will rightly be rejected.   You'll have to pull down their work first and
incorporate it into yours before you'll be allowed to push.  See Git Branching
for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.
