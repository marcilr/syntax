Reset or revert a specific file to a specific revision using Git?
=================================================================
Assuming the commit you want is abcde:

git checkout abcde file/to/restore
The git checkout man page gives more information.

Note if you want to revert changes made to the files in commit abcde you have
to pass the commit right before abcde. You can use abcde~1 for this.

As a side note, I've always been uncomfortable with this command because it's
used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and unusual
destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).

Hence:
    $ git log file/to/restore
    Get the commit number like:
    $ git checkout 5ed4f0c3ac0be7e92b606dee297285b025c068e5 generatorAlarms.go
    $ git commit
    $ git status


Example
=======
To revert last commit in the ???

1. Get prior revision history:
covellite:~/git/private/gci/projects/syniverse/jobs$ git log jobs.xlsx
