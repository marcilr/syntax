init


If you're starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the
project's directory and type:

  $ git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary
repository files - a Git repository skeleton.  At this point, nothing in your
project is tracked yet.  (See Git Internals for more information about exactly
what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.)
