Git - force a pull to overwrite everything, on every pull

Really the ideal way to do this is to not use pull at all, but instead fetch
and reset:

  git fetch origin master
  git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
  git clean -df

(Altering master to whatever branch you want to be following.)

pull is designed around merging changes together in some way, whereas reset is
designed around simply making your local copy match a specific commit.

You may want to consider slightly different options to clean depending on your
system's needs.
