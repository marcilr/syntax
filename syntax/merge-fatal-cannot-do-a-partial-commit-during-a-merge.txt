Git error on commit after merge - fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge


I ran a git pull that ended in conflict.  I resolved the conflict files and everything is fine now
(I use mergetool also).

When I commit the resolved file with git commit file.php -m "message" I get the error:

fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge.

I had the same issue before and using -a in commit worked perfectly.  I think it's not the prefect
way because I don't want to commit all changes.  I want to commit files separately with separate
comments.  How can I do that?  Why git doesn't allow users to commit files separately after a
merge? I could not find a satisfactory answer to this problem.

Answer
======
I found that adding "-i" to the commit command fixes this problem for me.  The -i basically tells
it to stage additional files before committing. That is:

git commit -i myfile.php
