How can I delete a file from git repo?


git rm file.txt removes the file from the repo but also deletes it from the
local file system.

To remove the file from the repo and not delete it from the local file system
use:
  git rm --cached file.txt

The below exact situation is where I use git to maintain version control for
my business's website, but the "mickey" directory was a tmp folder to share
private content with a CAD developer.  When he needed HUGE files, I made a
private, unlinked directory and ftpd the files there for him to fetch via
browser.  Forgetting I did this,  I later performed a git add -A from the
website's base directory.  Subsequently, git status showed the new files
needing committing.  Now I needed to delete them from git's tracking and
version control...

Sample output below is from what just happened to me, where I unintentionally
deleted the .003 file.  Thankfully, I don't care what happened to the local
copy to .003, but some of the other currently changed files were updates I
just made to the website and would be epic to have been deleted on the local
file system! "Local file system" = the live website (not a great practice, but
is reality).

[~/www]$ git rm shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.003
error: 'shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.003' has local modifications
(use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)
[~/www]$ git rm -f shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.003
rm 'shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.003'
[~/www]$ 
[~/www]$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   deleted:    shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.003
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.001
#   modified:   shop/mickey/mtt_flange_SCN.7z.002

Update: This answer is getting some traffic, so I thought I'd mention my other
Git answer[1] shares a couple of great resources: This page[2] has a graphic
that help demystify Git for me.  The "Pro Git" book is online[3] and helps me
a lot.
