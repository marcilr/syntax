View the change history of a file using Git versioning


How can I view the change history of an individual file in Git, complete with
what has changed?

I have got as far as:

  git log -- [filename]

which shows me the commit history of the file, but how do I get at the content
of each of the changes?

I'm trying to make the transition from MS SourceSafe and that used to be a
simple right-click -> show history.

You can use

git log -p filename
to let git generate the patches for each log entry.

See

git help log
for more options - it can actually do a lot of nice things :) To get just the
diff for a specific commit you can

git show HEAD 
or any other revision by identifier. Or use

gitk
to browse the changes visually.
