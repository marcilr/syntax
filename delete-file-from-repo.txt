Delete file from repo


I had added the 605M FreeNAS-11.1-U4.iso to the 
git/storage/freenas repository.  When I tried to 
push it to github I got a 100M max file size error.

Deleting FreeNAS-11.1-U4.iso from the freenas repository
did not truly remove it.  Hence the use of
'git filter-branch' command to truly remove it from the 
repository.

$ git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
