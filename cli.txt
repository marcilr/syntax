The Command Line


There are a lot of different ways to use Git.  There are the original command
line tools, and there are many graphical user interfaces of varying
capabilities.  For this book, we will be using Git on the command line.  For
one, the command line is the only place you can run all Git commands - most of
the GUIs only implement some subset of Git functionality for simplicity.  If
you know how to run the command line version, you can probably also figure out
how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true.  Also,
while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, all users
will have the command-line tools installed and available.
