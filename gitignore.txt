Ignoring Files

Often, you'll have a class of files that you don't want Git to automatically
add or even show you as being untracked.  These are generally automatically
generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system.  In
such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named
.gitignore .  Here is an example .gitignore file:

  $ cat .gitignore
  *.[oa]
  *~

The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in ".o" or ".a" - object
and archive files that may be the product of building your code.  The second
line tells Git to ignore all files that end with a tilde ( ~ ), which is used
by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files.  You may also
include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation;
and so on.  Setting up a .gitignore file before you get going is generally a
good idea so you don't accidentally commit files that you really don't want in
your Git repository.

The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:

o Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
o tandard glob patterns work.
o You can end patterns with a forward slash ( / ) to specify a directory.
o You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point ( ! ).

Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.  An
asterisk ( * ) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character
inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark ( ? ) matches a
single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a
hyphen( [0-9] ) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9).
You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match
a/z , a/b/z , a/b/c/z , and so on.

Here is another example .gitignore file:

# no .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in the build/ directory
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory
doc/**/*.txt

gitignore if you want a starting point for your project.
