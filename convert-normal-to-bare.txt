Convert a normal Git repository to a bare one


The main difference seems to be:
o in the normal git repository you have a .git folder inside the
  repository containing all relevant data and all other files build
  your working copy

o in a bare Git repository, there is no working copy and the folder
  (let's call it repo.git) contains the actual repository data



In short: replace the contents of repo with the contents of repo/.git,
then tell the repository that it is now a bare repository.

To do this, execute the following commands:

cd repo
mv .git ../repo.git # renaming just for clarity
cd ..
rm -fr repo
cd repo.git
git config --bool core.bare true

Thank you! This seems cleaner to me:
  mv repo/.git repo.git && rm -rf repo && \
  cd repo.git && git config --bool core.bare true

NOTE: git clone --bare /path/to/repo
      Wrong, this method is not the equivalent. Doing a clone doesn't 
      preserve config options, which can be critical to proper operation 
      such as if you use git-p4.  Additionally, a clone destroys remotes,
      again with something like git-p4 you lose the p4/master branch when
      you clone, so the above approach is preferable.
