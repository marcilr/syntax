Help


If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual
page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:
  $ git help <verb>
  $ git <verb> --help
  $ man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running
  $ git help config

These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.  If the
manpages and this book arenâ€™t enough and you need in-person help,p, you can try the
#git or #github channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.free-node.net).  These
channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are
all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help
